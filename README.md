# COMP3467 - Parallel Programming and System Administration

## Submission instructions

You **must** submit this coursework via **Gradescope**. These are the steps:

1. Commit any files that are needed to run your code. You can make as many commits as you like, but before submitting to Gradescope make sure that the latest version of the files in this repository is the one you want to have marked. You can check that the files are the ones you expect by using the file explorer at the top of the GitHub homepage for the repository. Make a note of the branch you have been using—this will appear one the top left corner, just above your profile picture at the top of the file explorer. By default, this will be *main* unless you have changed it.

2. Go to [https://github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications), select *Gradescope*, and grant *Organization access* to *COMP3467*.

1. Go to the *Blackboard Ultra* page for the course *COMP3467 - Advanced Computer Systems (23/24)*.

1. Click on *PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR SUMMATIVE ASSIGNMENT HERE* and then on *Gradescope*.

1. Click on *Advanced Computer Systems* to show the submission pop-up window.

1. The submission method *GitHub* should be the only one available. If not, select it.

1. From the *Repository* drop-down menu, choose the repository *COMP3467/comp3467-<github_username>*. If the repository does not appear, check that you have granted organization access to *Gradescope* as discussed above.

1. From the *Branch* drop-down menu, choose the branch you are working on. This will be *main* by default, but if any alternatives appear please make sure that you pick the correct one, which may or may not be *main*. You can check this on the GitHub homepage for the repository.

1. Provide a *Leaderboard Name*, which will not be used.

1. Click on *Upload*.

1. A dialog box with the message "Advanced Computer Systems submitted successfully!" should appear. You should also receive a confirmation of the submission via email. The latter should not be needed, but it might be a good idea to keep it around until the grades for this assignment are released.

## Miscellany

1. This is the first time we roll out the new GitHub/Gradescope workflow in the department, and there could be hiccups. Therefore, I'm releasing the assignment well in advance of the opening of the submission window on Gradescope.

1. You can resubmit your work as many times as you want, and only the last submission will be graded. Therefore, technical problems cannot be used as a justification for late submissions, as you can try out the process as soon as the submission window on Gradescope opens.

1. If you have any issues with the submission process, please contact [Laura](mailto:lzmr28@durham.ac.uk) at your earliest convenience.

1. I cannot answer individual questions about the assignment or provide feedback on your proposed solutions before the submission deadline. However, I can — and are happy to:

    + answer individual questions on the topics covered in the lectures, the lecture material, the references textbooks, or your work on any of the practicals,

    + answer technical questions related to setting up the environment for solving the assignment and

    + answer questions on the assignment, as long as they are publicly posted in the *Questions on the assignment* discussion under *Submodule 1: Coursework* in the Blackboard Ultra page for the module.
